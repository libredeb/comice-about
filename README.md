## How to Debug?

To debug a Vala application, you must follow these steps:

1. Create build folder with type debug:
   ```bash
   $ meson build --prefix=/usr --buildtype=debug
   ```
2. Compile `comice-about`:
   ```bash
   $ cd build
   $ ninja
   ```
3. Run the application in debug mode:
   ```bash
   $ gdb ./com.github.libredeb.comice-about
   ```

   The above command has the next output:
   ```bash
